## 🔒 SiuToken & DAO Governance Smart Contract

![SiuToken](./SiuToken.png)

A full-featured ERC-20 token and DAO system developed entirely in Solidity.  
This project includes dynamic fee distribution, token locking, batch airdrops, and on-chain governance with weighted voting.

### 🚀 Key Highlights

- ✅ **Custom ERC-20 Token** with fee logic and minting:  
  `1,000,000 SIU` total supply, with dynamic 1% transfer fee split across two addresses (40% / 60%).

- 🔐 **Token Locking Mechanism**:  
  Users can lock their tokens for a specific duration, preventing premature transfer.

- 🎯 **Fee Distribution Logic**:  
  Transfer fee automatically split and routed to multiple addresses on every transaction.

- 📦 **Batch Airdrop Tool**:  
  Gas-efficient batch distribution of SIU tokens to multiple addresses.

- 🗳️ **On-Chain DAO Voting System**:  
  SIU token holders can create proposals and vote based on real-time token balances.  
  Vote weights are calculated in raw token units (`wei`) and displayed in human-readable format (`SIU`).

- 📈 **Execution-Ready & Testnet Deployed**:  
  Contracts have been successfully deployed and tested on the Sepolia Ethereum testnet, using Remix + MetaMask.
